Feature: Add favorite recipes

    As an existing user
    So that I can select recipes that I like
    I should be able to favorite a recipe

    Background:

        # Given I am an existing user with email "john.apple@gmail.com" and password "hello1" and age "18" and height "160" and weight "60" and time "60"


        Given I am on the signup page
        And I fill in "user[email]" with "john.apple@gmail.com"
        And I fill in "user[password]" with "hello1"
        And I fill in "user[password_confirmation]" with "hello1"
        And I press "Sign up"
        And I fill in "age" with "18"
        And I fill in "weight" with "50"
        And I select "60" from "height"
        And I fill in "Time available to cook per day" with "60"
    # And I fill in "user[password_confirmation]" with "hello1"

    Scenario: Favorite recipe
        Given I press "Save Changes"
        And I favorite a "Breakfast" meal
        Then I should see "Favorites"
